The Application allows you to send out alerts to your friends after a night out, so if you were at a bar with friends, and wanted to make sure everyone got home safetly you can use this app to send out an alert to those selected.
If the alert isnt turned off or a message isnt sent back, the system will send a alert message to the other friends that were out with them. This can also be used to check in on older/sick family members. By giving them an alert in the morning when they wake up they would be able to in trouble or need help.
